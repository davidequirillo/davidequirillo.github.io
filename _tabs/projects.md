- [**Sentinel**](https://github.com/davidequirillo/sentinel): an educational prototype that demonstrates how a multimodal AI system can ingest, analyze and summarize heterogeneous data streams in real time.
The project is inspired by conceptual ideas seen in fictional films such as Person of Interest, but this implementation is strictly a technical experiment focused on concurrency, pipelines and AI preprocessing.

- [**XSS Exec Checker**](https://github.com/davidequirillo/xss-exec-checker): a command-line tool written in Python language, useful to check if a specific web endpoint is vulnerable to XSS attack. The program runs a static check and a dynamic check (using a browser engine to detect XSS execution).

- [**Dynalert**](https://github.com/davidequirillo/dynalert): Dinalert is a network alert manager: when the server receives an alert from a connected client (mostly a mobile device), it takes some decisions based on alert description, and then it sends a push notification to the authorities, and to all geolocalized nearby persons (clients). NOTE: this project is under construction.
