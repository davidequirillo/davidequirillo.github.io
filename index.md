### **Software & Security Engineer | M.Sc. in Computer Science**

> "Bridging the gap between robust software engineering and proactive security."

As a *Master of Science graduate in Computer Science*, I combine a deep theoretical foundation in **distributed systems** with a hands-on passion for **offensive security**. My approach is simple: I build resilient systems by thinking like an attacker.

Solving **medium-level CTFs** and researching vulnerabilities (such as XSS and CSRF) isn't just a hobby: it’s how I’ve shaped my **Security by Design** philosophy. I believe that scalability and performance are meaningless if they aren't backed by a secure architecture.

### 🛠️ Current Focus & Projects

* **Full-Stack Development**: 
    designing high-performance client-server ecosystems using FastAPI and Flutter.
* **Cloud & Orchestration**: 
    I have architected my latest systems to be fully containerized and Kubernetes-ready, simulating production-grade environments to ensure maximum scalability and cost-efficiency.
* **Security Research**:
    developing custom tools and scripts to automate vulnerability assessment and strengthen system defenses.

### 🚀 Goal
My goal is to transform complex architectural challenges into secure, elegant, and battle-hardened solutions. I am driven by the belief that a system is only as strong as its weakest link, and I work every day to strengthen those links through code and infrastructure.
